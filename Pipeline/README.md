python train.py  
```

In order to test that predict works on a test set you created run:

```bash
python predict.py models/linear_regression_model.sav data/X_test.csv data/y_test.csv

## Limitations

development libraries are part of the production environment, normally these would be separate as the production code should be as slim as possible
